# FireTV_Swift_TCP_Remote

A lightweight demo project that shows how to set up real-time TCP communication between a Swift-based iOS app (acting as a server) and a Java-based Fire TV app (acting as a client).

This is **not a full framework**, but a clean base to build your own remote control system or cross-device command app using plain TCP sockets.

## âœ¨ Features

- Real-time TCP messaging over LAN
- Swift-based iOS server with live connection status
- Java-based Fire TV client with persistent reconnect logic
- Swift Server Sending Commands to Fire TV (For You To Implement Client Side)
